Relates to Version 2.04 of GEN80
       and Version 2.7  of PMON
********************************

  ******************************
  Large-Screen PCW Configuration
  ******************************

The CP/M Plus versions of HDE, MON80
and PMON are configured for a 24-line,
80-column screen so that they will run
immediately on both the CPC6128 and the
PCW8256/8512 in 24 by 80 mode.

If you wish to use the full screen
versions of these programs then you
should run the relevant installation
program (HDEINST, MON80INS, PMONINS),
choose option 2 and select 31 lines
and 90 columns.

******************
GEN80 Version 2.05
******************

Hex output for BASIC, Pascal etc.
---------------------------------

Use the *J+ command to turn this
output on or *J- to turn it off.
Default is off. When on, the 
assembler will generate hex
numbers to a file name.CDE, where
name is the object filename. You
can choose the length of each line
by using GEN80INS. You can also
choose what should go at the start
of each line, at the end of each 
line, the prefix to the hex number and
the separator of each hex number. 
Use GEN80INS for all these options.
The assmebler command *O nnnn allows
you to have decimal line numbers
(starting at nnnn, increasing by 10)
at the start of each line.

Example for Mallard BASIC:

*J+
*O 1000   ;on a separate line

	ld	hl,label
	ret
label	defm	"Test"

Using GEN80INS set:

Length: 80
Header: DATA 
Trailer: (none)
Hex prefix: &H
Hex separator: ,

GEN80 TEST

then gives a file TEST.CDE which
looks like:

1000 DATA &H21,&H04,&H01,&HC9,&H54,&H65,&H73,&H74

GEN80INS has been modified so that
the above features may be installed.
Type [CTRL]-D or [ALT]-D to delete
the header, trailer or hex prefix
(identifier) when using the 
installation program. Otherwise,
enter the text you want (up to 12
characters for the header and
trailer or 6 characters for the hex
prefix) followed by [ENTER].

******************
GEN80 Version 2.06
******************

1. Previously, when assembling with option F
(force second pass), doubly-defined symbols
would not be detected. This has been fixed.

2. Previously, the name of the module output
to any .REL file was padded right with spaces
to ensure a 6 character length. This can
be tedious when used with LIB. We have
changed this so that the correct length (up
to 6 characters) is always output.
